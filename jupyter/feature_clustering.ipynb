       "0   The reason y i dropped out of school was because either , i drop out or i got kicked out. i always fought with the packi gang at my school. and i was never going to back down. in auto class i handed the n * igger a monkey wrench and told him the name suited him aswell. all the non-whites hated me because i wore a `` nazi punk '' and a `` white pride '' patch on my coat and backpack. a got in a fight with some black chick and i won. the next day her butchy sister caught up with me in the hall way and said that after school her and i where gonna fight. i told her `` no if u wanna fight , we 're gonna fight right here right now. not after school where u can gather the rest of u monkies up so it 's an uneven fight '' . she huffed and stormed away. - we neevr did get to fight the last straw was the first day of school i had a forgein substitute teacher. so i was talkin and and this guy was on my case about turning around and getting my work done. he had to ask me this a few times and then finially i stood up and said , `` look , i 'm white ur black , i should be telling u whut to do ! '' ohhh man , my guidance conslour did n't like that nor did my principal .... ( this was n't at school this happened a month or so ago but these people went to my school ) i had a n * igger try to rob me at knife point in the forest while his gf sat back and watched. my friend came by and jumped him and i personally went after the chick. she ran and i caught up to her and smashed her head into a tree. thats only some of my stories ....... i got a few more but i dont have the time   \n",

       "0   why do you white nationalist try to spread fear in blacks saying that the jews do not care for them. jews are the reason affirmative action is in place which allows us to take your jobs. jews are the reason so many blacks have become rich including myself. so why do you think their just using us ? jews are your enemy and so are we so what you feel you need to do is make your enemy against each other. is that right. you want blacks against the jews. well guess what , not goinna happen. the jews needs blacks as much as blacks need the jews and together they are a force to be recon with .   \n",
